# AgriSathi APK Build Guide

Your React app has been successfully configured with Capacitor for Android development! Here's how to complete the APK build process:

## Prerequisites Setup

### 1. Install Android Studio
- Download and install Android Studio from: https://developer.android.com/studio
- During installation, make sure to install:
  - Android SDK
  - Android SDK Platform-Tools
  - Android SDK Build-Tools
  - Android Emulator (optional, for testing)

### 2. Set Environment Variables
After installing Android Studio, set up these environment variables:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Add to your PowerShell profile or set permanently in System Properties
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
$env:PATH += ";$env:ANDROID_HOME\tools;$env:ANDROID_HOME\platform-tools"
```

**Alternative: Create local.properties file**
Create a file `android/local.properties` with:
```
sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```

## Build Commands

### Option 1: Build APK via Command Line
```bash
# Build the web app and sync with Capacitor
npm run build:mobile

# Navigate to android directory and build
cd android
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be generated at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Option 2: Build via Android Studio (Recommended)
```bash
# Open the Android project in Android Studio
npm run cap:open
```

Then in Android Studio:
1. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
2. Go to Build â†’ Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) â†’ Build APK(s)
3. The APK will be generated in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`
